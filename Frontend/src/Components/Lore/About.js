            <h1>About the game:</h1>
            <div>This game is the senior project that me and my group chose for the semester.
                It is a board game that requires you to pass a series of mini-games to win.
                You will be given the option to pick your character's class at the beginning of the game.
                There are also some power ups that you can pick along the way.
                The game also records everyone's score, so you can see the high scores of the game.
